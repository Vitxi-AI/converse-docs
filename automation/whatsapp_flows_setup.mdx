### **What are WhatsApp Flows:**

**WhatsApp Flows** are interactive forms built directly inside WhatsApp chats, allowing businesses to collect information from users quickly and smoothly. Instead of asking multiple back-and-forth questions, businesses can present a simple form where users can fill in details like name, email, preferences, or feedback all in one go. Flows make the experience faster, more organized, and user-friendly, helping businesses generate leads, take orders, book appointments, or gather customer inputs without needing users to leave the chat. They are extremely useful for improving response rates, reducing manual effort, and offering a professional and seamless customer experience.
