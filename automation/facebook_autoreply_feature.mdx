### **What is Facebook Auto Reply?**

Facebook Auto Reply is an automation feature that allows you to automatically respond to users who comment on your Facebook posts. Instead of manually replying to each comment, auto reply tools like BotPenguin enable you to configure predefined messages—or even AI-generated responses—that are instantly sent as either public comments or direct messages (DMs).

This functionality ensures your page remains active, responsive, and engaging—without requiring constant manual effort.
