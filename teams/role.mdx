### **How to create a new Role**

1. Click on the "Roles" panel to view and manage the roles you have created.
2. \
   Next, click on **"Create Role"** to start the process of creating a new role.
3. \
   Add **“Name”** and **“Description”** for your role.
4. **Assign Permissions:** You can select the sections you want to allow or block users from accessing in this role.

   **\
   Read:** It grants users access to only view the selected section.

   **Write:** It grants users access to make changes in the selected section.

   **Delete:** It allows users to delete existing items within the selected section.

Let's illustrate this with an example in the **Inbox —\> Chats** section:

- **Read Access**: Users can view all chats across all chatbots but cannot edit or delete them.
- **Write Access**: Users can view and edit any chat across all chatbots but cannot delete them.
- **Delete Access**: Users can view and delete any chat across all chatbots but cannot edit them.

After giving the necessary permissions, proceed by clicking on **"Create Role"** located at the bottom.

Your role will be created.

- **Status:** If the status of a role is **"active"**, it can be assigned to any team member. If the role is **“inactive”**, it cannot be assigned to anyone.
- **Action:** You can **edit** or **delete** any of the existing roles from here.
