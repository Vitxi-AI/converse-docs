### **Introduction**

Quick Replies are pre-built responses that can be saved and used during live chat interactions. They enhance efficiency by allowing users or live chat agents to quickly access and send commonly used phrases, images, or documents as responses to the customer. By entering '/' into the live chat input window(in the inbox), the system automatically fetches the list of saved Quick Replies, and enables users to select and send the appropriate response effortlessly.
